# Travel Journal

## What is it?

This is simply exactly what it says on the tin (or, in this case, README file) - it's a travel journal! It's not dynamic or interactive, but it's a good representation (at the very least) of what a digital travel journal could look like.

## How does it work?

Well, it doesn't really. Not really. Not right now. There is room for expansion and such but for now it's "for display purposes only".

## Who made it?

I did, of course ('I' being Matthew Aileru). All from scratch and everything :-D

## Where does it come from?

It came from a solo project assignment from Module 11 (at the time of writing as they are almost always updating the curriculum) of 'The Front-End Developer Career Path' offered by Scrimba.

## Why does this exist?

It was built for the sheer purpose of practising what I've learnt about React up to this point in time, so a good static page project to do from scratch without any hand-holding or training wheels.

## Anything else?

Erm...not right now to be honest, but we'll see what the future holds.
